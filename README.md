# CharityML
Finding Donors for Charity - Udacity NanoDegree Machine learning project

# Project Description
In this project, I used sklearn and supervised learning techniques on data collected for the U.S. census to help a fictitious charity organization identify people most likely to donate to their cause.

Fistly preprocessing of data is done and then I first investigate the factors that affect the likelihood of charity donations being made. Then, I use a training and predicting pipeline to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency/speed of three supervised machine learning algorithms (GaussianNB, SVC, Adaboost). I then proceed to fine tune the parameters of the algorithm that provides the highest donation yield (while reducing mailing efforts/costs). Finally, I also explore the impact of reducing number of features in data.

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper "Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid", by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper online, with the original dataset hosted on UCI.
